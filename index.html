            Hi, I'm Haruto, a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, expecting to graduate Decemeber 2025.
            I have experiences in UI/UX and frontend software engineering. I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality results while continuously learning and growing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests range from open-source projects, cybersecuirty, and supply chain to sustainability, public transit, and linguistics.
            I support open-source projects because I believe that's how software - or anything else for that matter - should be. I'm a daily user of many of the popular projects, and I wish to contribute in the near future.
            I also support public transportation. I think infrastructure like transit is the backbone of a healthy and wealthy society. I like learning about policy and planning as a novice, and I hope to be able to use my programming skills in this field. If you ask me about anything related to transit, I'll either already have a strong opinion on it, or be asking to learn all about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a new grad, I'm looking for an entry-level frontend software engineer, especially in the field of public transportation, sustainability, or plant-based food innovation.
            In the future, I would like to expand my expertise to system administration and cryptography. My dream job is to work as a full-time employee at a free and open-source project like Signal, Mozilla, Red Hat, or BitWarden.
